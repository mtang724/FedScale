# Configuration file of FAR training experiment

# ========== Cluster configuration ==========
# ip address of the parameter server (need 1 GPU process)
ps_ip: localhost

# ip address of each worker:# of available gpus process on each gpu in this node
# Note that if we collocate ps and worker on same GPU, then we need to decrease this number of available processes on that GPU by 1
# E.g., master node has 4 available processes, then 1 for the ps, and worker should be set to: worker:3
